CV Maker (minimal scaffold)

This folder contains a minimal Vite + React scaffold for the CV Maker MVP.

Quick start (Windows, cmd.exe):

1. Install dependencies:

```
cd "d:\chay aur react\cvMaker"
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server:

```
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- The editor autosaves to localStorage.
- Use "Export JSON" to download your CV as a JSON file.
- This is a minimal scaffold. I can add drag-and-drop, PDF export, templates and tests next.
